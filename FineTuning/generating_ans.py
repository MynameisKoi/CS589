The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise \
in AI jobs, and \
many people are building exciting careers \
in this field. A \
career is a decades-long journey, and the \
path is not always \
straightforward. Over many years, I’ve \
been privileged to see \
thousands of students as well as engineers \
in companies large \
and small navigate careers in AI. In this \
and the next few letters, \
I’d like to share a few thoughts that \
might be useful in \
charting your own course.

Three key steps of career growth are \
learning (to gain technical \
and other skills), working on projects \
(to deepen skills, build \
a portfolio, and create impact) and \
searching for a job. \
These steps stack on top of each other:

Initially, you focus on gaining \
foundational technical skills.
After having gained foundational skills, \
you lean into project \
work. During this period, you’ll \
probably keep learning.
Later, you might occasionally carry \
out a job search. Throughout \
this process, you’ll probably continue \
to learn and work on \
meaningful projects.
These phases apply in a wide range of \
professions, but AI involves \
unique elements. For example:

AI is nascent, and many technologies \
are still evolving. While the \
foundations of machine learning and \
deep learning are maturing — and \
coursework is an efficient way to \
master them — beyond these \
foundations, keeping up-to-date with \
changing technology is more \
important in AI than fields that \
are more mature.
Project work often means working \
with stakeholders who lack \
expertise in AI. This can make it \
challenging to find a suitable \
project, estimate the project’s \
timeline and return on investment, \
and set expectations. In addition, \
the highly iterative nature of \
AI projects leads to special challenges \
in project management: How \
can you come up with a plan for building \
a system when you don’t \
know in advance how long it will take \
to achieve the target accuracy? \
Even after the system has hit the \
target, further iteration may be \
necessary to address post-deployment drift.
While searching for a job in AI can \
be similar to searching for a \
job in other sectors, there are some \
differences. Many companies \
are still trying to figure out which AI \
skills they need and how to \
hire people who have them. Things you’\
ve worked on may be \
significantly different than anything \
your interviewer has seen, \
and you’re more likely to have to \
educate potential employers \
about some elements of your work.
Throughout these steps, a supportive \
community is a big help. \
Having a group of friends and allies \
who can help you — and whom \
you strive to help — makes the path \
easier. This is true whether \
you’re taking your first steps or you’\
ve been on the journey for years.

I’m excited to work with all of you to \
grow the global AI community, \
and that includes helping everyone in \
our community develop their \
careers. I’ll dive more deeply into \
these topics in the next few weeks.

Last week, I wrote about key steps for \
building a career in AI: learning \
technical skills, doing project work, and \
searching for a job, all of which \
is supported by being part of a community. \
In this letter, I’d like to \
dive more deeply into the first step.

More papers have been published on AI \
than any person can read in \
a lifetime. So, in your efforts to learn, \
it’s critical to \
prioritize topic selection. I believe the \
most important topics \
for a technical career in machine learning are:

Foundational machine learning skills. For \
example, it’s important \
to understand models such as linear \
regression, logistic regression, \
neural networks, decision trees, clustering, \
and anomaly detection. \
Beyond specific models, it’s even more \
important to understand the \
core concepts behind how and why machine \
learning works, such as \
bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \
optimization algorithms, \
and error analysis.
Deep learning. This has become such a large \
fraction of machine \
learning that it’s hard to excel in the \
field without some understanding \
of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of \
neural networks, practical \
skills for making them work (such as \
hyperparameter tuning), \
convolutional networks, sequence models, \
and transformers.
Math relevant to machine learning. Key \
areas include linear \
algebra (vectors, matrices, and various \
manipulations of them) \
as well as probability and statistics \
(including discrete and \
continuous probability, standard probability \
distributions, \
basic rules such as independence and Bayes \
rule, and hypothesis \
testing). In addition, exploratory data \
analysis (EDA) — using \
visualizations and other methods to \
systematically explore a \
dataset — is an underrated skill. I’ve \
found EDA particularly \
useful in data-centric AI development, \
where analyzing errors \
and gaining insights can really help \
drive progress! Finally, \
a basic intuitive understanding of \
calculus will also help. \
In a previous letter, I described how \
the math \
needed to do machine learning well has \
been changing. For \
instance, although some tasks require \
calculus, improved automatic \
differentiation software makes it \
possible to invent and implement \
new neural network architectures \
without doing any calculus. This \
was almost impossible a decade ago.\
Software development. While you can \
get a job and \
make huge contributions with only machine \
learning modeling skills, \
your job opportunities will increase if \
you can also write \
good software to implement complex AI \
systems. These skills \
include programming fundamentals, data \
structures (especially those that \
relate to machine learning, such as \
data frames), \
algorithms (including those related to \
databases and data manipulation\
), software design, familiarity with Python, \
and familiarity \
with key libraries such as TensorFlow \
or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.\
This is a lot to learn! Even after you \
master everything in this list, I hope you’ll \
keep learning and continue to deepen \
your technical knowledge. \
I’ve known many machine learning engineers \
who benefitted \
from deeper skills in an application area \
such as natural \
language processing or computer vision, \
or in a technology \
area such as probabilistic graphical \
models or building scalable software \
systems.

How do you gain these skills? There’s
a lot of good content on the internet, and
in theory reading dozens of web pages could work.
But when the goal is deep understanding, \
reading disjointed
web pages is inefficient because they \
tend to repeat each
other, use inconsistent terminology \
(which slows you down
), vary in quality, and leave gaps. That
’s why a good course — in which a
body of material has been organized into \
a coherent and
logical form — is often the most \
time-efficient
way to master a meaningful body of knowledge. \
When you’
ve absorbed the knowledge available \
in courses, you can
switch over to research papers and \
other resources.

Finally, keep in mind that no one can \
cram everything they
need to know over a weekend or even a \
month. Everyone
I know who’s great at machine learning \
is a lifelong
learner. In fact, given how quickly our \
field is changing
, there’s little choice but to keep \
learning if you
want to keep up. How can you maintain \
a steady pace
of learning for years? I’ve written \
about the value
of habits. If you cultivate the habit \
of learning a little
bit every week, you can make significant \
progress with what feels
like less effort.

In the last two letters, I wrote about \
developing a career
in AI and shared tips for gaining \
technical skills. This
time, I’d like to discuss an important step
in building a career: project work.

It goes without saying that we should \
only work on projects
that are responsible and ethical, and \
that benefit people.
But those limits leave a large variety \
to choose from.
I wrote previously about how to identify \
and scope AI projects
. This and next week’s letter have \
a different
emphasis: picking and executing projects \
with an eye
toward career development.

A fruitful career will include many projects, \
hopefully growing in
scope, complexity, and impact over time. Thus,
it is fine to start small. Use early projects to
learn and gradually step up to bigger \
projects as your skills grow.

When you’re starting out, don’t expect
others to hand great ideas or resources \
to you on a
platter. Many people start by working on \
small projects in
their spare time. With initial successes — \
even small ones
— under your belt, your growing skills \
increase your ability
to come up with better ideas, and it \
becomes easier
to persuade others to help you step up \
to bigger projects.

What if you don’t have any project ideas?
Here are a few ways to generate them:

Join existing projects. If you find someone \
else with an
idea, ask to join their project.
Keep reading and talking to people. I come \
up with
new ideas whenever I spend a lot of time reading,
taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’
m confident that you will, too.
Focus on an application area. Many researchers \
are trying to
advance basic AI technology — say, by \
inventing the next
generation of transformers or further \
scaling up
language models — so, while this is an \
exciting
direction, it is hard.
But the variety of applications to which \
machine learning has
not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate
to have been able to apply neural networks \
to everything from
autonomous helicopter flight to online \
advertising, partly
because I jumped in when relatively few \
people were working on
those applications. If your company or \
school cares about a
particular application, explore the \
possibilities for machine
learning. That can give you a first \
look at a potentially
creative application — one where you \
can do unique work —
that no one else has done yet.
Develop a side hustle. Even if you have \
a full-time job, a
fun project that may or may not develop \
into something bigger
can stir the creative juices and strengthen \
bonds with collaborators.
When I was a full-time professor, working on
online education wasn’t part of my “job” \
(which was doing
research and teaching classes). It was a \
fun hobby that I
often worked on out of passion for \
education. My early
experiences recording videos at home \
helped me later in
working on online education in a more \
substantive way.
Silicon Valley abounds with stories of \
startups that started as side
projects. So long as it doesn’t create a \
conflict with your
employer, these projects can be a stepping \
stone to something
significant.  Given a few project ideas, \
which one should
you jump into?
Here’s a quick checklist of factors \
to consider:

Will the project help you grow technically? \
Ideally, it should
be challenging enough to stretch your \
skills but not so hard
that you have little chance of success. \
This will put you on
a path toward mastering ever-greater \
technical complexity.
Do you have good teammates to work with? \
If not, are there
people you can discuss things with? \
We learn a lot from the
people around us, and good collaborators \
will have a huge
impact on your growth.
Can it be a stepping stone? If the project \
is successful,
will its technical complexity and/or \
business impact make it
a meaningful stepping stone to larger \
projects? (If the
project is bigger than those you’ve \
worked on before
, there’s a good chance it could be \
such a stepping stone.)
Finally, avoid analysis paralysis. It \
doesn’t make
sense to spend a month deciding whether \
to work on a
project that would take a week to complete. \
You'
ll work on multiple projects over the \
course of your career
, so you’ll have ample opportunity to \
refine your
thinking on what’s worthwhile. Given \
the huge number
of possible AI projects, rather than the \
conventional “ready
, aim, fire” approach, you can accelerate your
progress with “ready, fire, aim.”
