GPTsUsers can create and share access to their own customized versions of ChatGPT called âGPTsâ.For Builders of GPTs:(a) GPT Content. The information or content that you upload to or include with your GPT (for example your GPT name, instructions, and description) (âGPT Contentâ) is your Content. As between you and OpenAI, you are solely responsible for your GPT Content, Actions, and configurations that you use or enable to create your GPT as well as any Output that is based on your GPT Content, Actions, and configurations. You must ensure your GPT complies with the Agreement and our Usage Policies.(b) Distribution and Promotion of GPTs. By sharing your GPT with others, you grant a nonexclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license: (i) to OpenAI to use, test, store, copy, translate, display, modify, distribute, promote, and otherwise make available to other users all or any part of your GPT (including GPT Content); and (ii) to the extent Output from your GPT includes your GPT Content, to users of your GPT to use, store, copy, display, distribute, prepare derivative works of and otherwise use your GPT Content. You will ensure that all information that you publish about your GPT is, at all times, complete, accurate, and not misleading.(c) Actions. Any API, website, or service that interacts with a GPT (an âActionâ) is subject to our Plugins and Actions Terms and you are responsible for ensuring that any Action included with your GPT operates in compliance with those terms. (d) Removal. We may reject or remove any GPT from our Services at any time for any reason without notice to you, such as for legal or security reasons or if your GPT violates our Terms.Â Â For Users of GPTs:(a) Third Party GPTs. Except where OpenAI is identified as the builder of a GPT, GPTs are created by other users and they may rely on content or third party applications that are not controlled by OpenAI. Use of âGPTâ in the name of a GPT created by other users does not imply that OpenAI created, supports or endorses the GPT. Only use GPTs that you know and trust.(b) Abuse Reporting. You can report GPTs that violate our Usage Policies using our reporting feature within ChatGPT.(c) Actions. GPTs may allow you to interact with Actions. Those Actions are subject to our terms for Plugins and Actions below.(d) Changes and Removal. OpenAI and creators of GPTs can remove GPTs at any time for any reason without prior notice.6. Image CapabilitiesOur models can accept images as part of Inputs to the Service (âImage Capabilitiesâ).(a) Not for Medical Advice. Image Capabilities are not designed or intended to be used as a medical device or to perform any medical function and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, or judgment.Â (b) Images with People. You may not use Image Capabilities to assist in identifying a person or to solicit or infer private or sensitive information about a person.7. Plugins and Actions(a) Overview. Plugins and Actions (together âPluginsâ) are features in ChatGPT that allow you to send instructions to and receive information from another application or website (âApplicationâ) while using our Services. Each Plugin is made available by the developer of the Application, which is typically a third party not affiliated with OpenAI. You may take action on an Application through one or more Plugins. For example, you may enable a plugin for a restaurant reservation website to request a reservation via the Services. You are solely responsible for the actions you take using Plugins. You must manually enable each plugin, which allows the applicable Service to access and use the enabled plugin. OpenAI may (but will have no obligation) to review, refuse, or remove Applications from ChatGPT. However, by using Plugins, you may be exposed to Applications or content that you may find offensive, inappropriate or objectionable. You agree that you use Plugins at your own risk. DO NOT ENABLE A PLUGIN UNLESS YOU KNOW AND TRUST THE UNDERLYING APPLICATION AND HAVE REVIEWED ITS TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY.(b) Plugin Operation and Content. When you enable a plugin, the Services will send applicable portions of your Content and certain information such as your country and state (âPlugin Dataâ) via the plugin to the Application. By enabling the plugin, you authorize and instruct us to send your Plugin Data to the applicable Application, which will be handled in accordance with its terms. We are not responsible for Plugin Data after it has been provided to an Application other than Applications owned by us. The Plugin will retrieve information and content from the Application, which may be included in Output you receive from the Services. This information and content included in the Output is not owned by you or OpenAI, and may be subject to the terms of the Application.8. Voice ConversationsVoice conversations is a ChatGPT feature that allows you to speak to our models and have them speak back (âChatGPT Voice Outputâ). ChatGPT Voice Output is for non-commercial use only and may not be distributed or repackaged as a standalone audio recording or any other sound file. Any rights in Output assigned to you do not include ChatGPT Voice Output.ResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewTeamEnterprisePricingTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2024Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
