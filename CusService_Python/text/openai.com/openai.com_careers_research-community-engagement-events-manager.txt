One of the central vehicles leveraged for engaging external community members is the OpenAI Forum community. Itâs an initiative that brings together domain experts and students to discuss and collaborate on the present and future of AI. The OpenAI Forum features events such as in-person meet-ups highlighting technical talks and dinner-mixers at OpenAI, educational webinars and expert roundtable conversations, and plenty of opportunity for members (including OpenAI researchers) to network and cross pollinate ideas. Community members may also be invited to participate in paid activities that directly impact OpenAI models, such as model evaluations, evaluation set creation, and provide support for the Preparedness teamâs work to ensure the safety of frontier models. The OpenAI Forum team supports community engagement cross functionally, meeting the needs of OpenAI researchers and the applied team as they surface.Â As an OpenAI Forum Community Engagement & Events Manager, you will support the Community Lead on the Human Data team with planning and execution of all events related to OpenAI Forum community engagement, AI trainer engagement, as well as engagement initiatives across the organization when our community building and events expertise is needed.
