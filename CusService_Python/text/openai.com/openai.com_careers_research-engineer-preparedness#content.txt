To ensure that AI promotes positive change, we have dedicated a team to help us best prepare for the development of increasingly capable frontier AI models. This team, Preparedness, reports directly to our CTO and is tasked with identifying, tracking, and preparing for catastrophic risks related to frontier AI models.Specifically, the mission of the Preparedness team is to:Closely monitor and predict the evolving capabilities of frontier AI systems, with an eye towards misuse risks whose impact could be catastrophic (not necessarily existential) to our society; andEnsure we have concrete procedures, infrastructure and partnerships to mitigate these risks and, more broadly, to safely handle the development of powerful AI systems.Our team will tightly connect capability assessment, evaluations, and internal red teaming for frontier models, as well as overall coordination on AGI preparedness. The teamâs core goal is to ensure that we have the infrastructure needed for the safety of highly-capable AI systemsâfrom the models we develop in the near future to those with AGI-level capabilities.Â About youWe are looking to hire exceptional research engineers that can push the boundaries of our frontier models. Specifically, we are looking for those that will help us shape our empirical grasp of the whole spectrum of AI safety concerns and will own individual threads within this endeavor end-to-end.In this role, you will:Work on identifying emerging AI safety risks and new methodologies for exploring the impact of these risksBuild (and then continuously refine) evaluations of frontier AI models that assess the extent of identified risksDesign and build scalable systems and processes that can support these kinds of evaluationsContribute to the refinement of risk management and the overall development of "best practice" guidelines for AI safety evaluationsWe expect you to be:Passionate and knowledgeable about short-term and long-term AI safety risksAble to think outside the box and have a robust âred-teaming mindsetâExperienced in ML research engineering, ML observability and monitoring, creating large language model-enabled applications, and/or another technical domain applicable to AI riskAble to operate effectively in a dynamic and extremely fast-paced research environment as well as scope and deliver projects end-to-endIt would be great if you also have:First-hand experience in red-teaming systemsâbe it computer systems or otherwiseA good understanding of the (nuances of) societal aspects of AI deploymentAn ability to work cross-functionallyExcellent communication skillsCompensation, Benefits and PerksTotal compensation also includes generous equity and benefits.Medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your familyMental health and wellness support401(k) plan with 4% matchingUnlimited time off and 18+ company holidays per yearPaid parental leave (20 weeks) and family-planning supportAnnual learning & development stipend ($1,500 per year)Annual Salary Range$200,000â$370,000 USDAbout OpenAIOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.
