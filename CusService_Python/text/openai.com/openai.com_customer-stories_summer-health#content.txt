However, as any parent or doctor knows, medical care doesnât end when the visit is over. Thatâs where medical visit notes come in, documenting what was discussed, what the care plan is, and any necessary follow-ups.Â Traditionally, medical visit notes are a common source of frustration for both doctors and parents. Pediatricians need to painstakingly translate their detailed observations from medical shorthand into a complete summary of the visit. Medical care providers spend over 50% of their time on administrative tasks like writing visit notes, taking time away from providing patient care and leading to burnout. Meanwhile, parents often experience delays in receiving visit notes, and these notes typically contain medical jargon and can be hard to understand.Â Summer Health believed that generative AI could help radically improve medical visit notes for parents, all while saving time for providers. After a pediatrician writes down their observations during the visit, an LLM could summarize this text into clear, jargon-free notes that could be easily shared.Â As Summer Health explored potential partners, OpenAI stood out, because its platform offered leading LLM models along with the ability to provide Business Associate Agreement (BAAs)Â  to fulfill HIPAA compliance. GPT-4's robust capabilities in understanding complex medical language and its adaptability to user requirements made it the ideal choice for this use case.We thought this was something we would get to in 5 years. Seeing that vision pulled forward has been amazing, and weâre excited to continue this journey with OpenAI.Matthew Woo, co-founder and Head of Product at Summer HealthSummer Health quickly built and launched their new medical visit notes feature, which uses GPT-4 to automatically generate visit notes from a doctorâs detailed written observations. Notes are then quickly reviewed by the pediatrician before being shared with parents. In collaboration with OpenAI, Summer Health rigorously fine-tuned the model, added a clinical review process to ensure accuracy and relevance in medical contexts, and continues to improve the model based on expert feedback.Â The results have been transformative:Pediatrician efficiency: Doctors have reported a significant reduction in the time taken for note-taking and administrative tasks by 5x, from 10 minutes per visit note to 2 minutes. This allows them more time for patient care and reduces end-of-day fatigue for providers, as well as improving note accuracy and consistency. Delays in completing visit notes have been reduced by 400%.Parent satisfaction: The feedback from parents has been overwhelmingly positive. Many shared that these visit notes were the best they ever experienced. They appreciated the clear, concise notes and felt more informed about their child's health and any recommended follow-up actions.Matthew Woo, co-founder and Head of Product at Summer Health, said, âWe thought this was something we would get to in 5 years.
