These guidelines are intended to help our partners, resellers, customers, developers, consultants, publishers, and any other third parties understand how to use and display our trademarks and copyrighted work in their own assets and materials.Powered by OpenAI badgeIf you are an active OpenAI API customer building using the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 series of our large language models, DALLÂ·E 2 or DALLÂ·E 3 image generation models, or any other OpenAI model or API, we encourage you to use our âPowered by OpenAIâ badge to signify that you use our APIs to build your product or features.Outlined badge on dark (preferred)Outlined badge on light (preferred)Filled badge on darkFilled badge on lightDownload badgesBest practices when using our badgeUse the outlined badge version whenever possible. The filled badge version should be used when placed over a background image and when legibility is a concern.Use enough space around the badgeâat least the size of the OpenAI logo that appears in the badge.Use at a minimum badge height of 32px.Donât modify the badge in any way.Donât translate the badge. In the future, we may provide translated versions for use directly.LanguageIf you are an active OpenAI API customer, please draw from the following language to accurately describe your company or productâs development on our APIs in any text. This language can be used for product UI, promotional and press materials, and App Store descriptions.Â Please use descriptive phrases that make it clear your product is developed on OpenAI technology (âpowered byâ is preferred, but âbuilt onâ can also be used). Avoid phrases that imply an official partnership with OpenAI (âbuilt withâ âdeveloped withâ âpartnered withâ).Your company or product name should appear first, followed by OpenAI or the model.Do:Meowlytics powered by OpenAIMeowlytics built on OpenAIMeowlytics developed on OpenAIDonât:Meowlytics with GPT-4Meowlytics AI by OpenAIChatGPT for MeowlyticsModelsIf you must refer to specific models,Â please use the proper model names or date-based versions of models when referring to OpenAI models.We do not permit the use of OpenAI models or âGPTâ in product or app names because it confuses end users.Do:Identify and refer to the appropriate model names: GPT-3, GPT-4, DALLÂ·E 3Refer to date-based versions of models if needed: GPT-4 Nov 6 versionUse âpowered by OpenAIâ when referring generally to OpenAI modelsDonât:Use OpenAI models in product or app names: GPT4Meow, MeowGPTUse model names incorrectly: Chat GPT, ChatGPT4, GPTChatDonât use the model classes: Ada, Babbage, Curie, Davinci, GPT-3.5-turboDonât use specific names: text-davinci-003Use âGPTâ generically without identifying the specific model: GPT-poweredPowered by OpenAI. A general, simplified way to describe products that are built on OpenAI models or multiple OpenAI models. Where possible, we recommend and prefer that you use the âPowered by OpenAIâ badge provided above. Please do not say âpowered by ChatGPTâ or âbuilt with ChatGPTâ to refer to products built with our APIs.Notifying users. If your product closely resembles an OpenAI product (such as ChatGPT), please make a clear indication to users that your product is independently developed and not affiliated, endorsed, or sponsored by OpenAI. Please consider your use of OpenAIâs product names, your own product copy, surrounding copy (e.g., app description), and any/all other attributes in this regard. It should be clear to your users that your application is separate and distinct from OpenAIâs own products and services.GPTs in ChatGPTGPTsâcustom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose with instructions, expanded knowledge, and custom actionsâare available to ChatGPT users.GPTs should have a short name appropriate for display in ChatGPTâs sidebar. Choose a name appropriate for an app or service, not the title of a document or video. Having a GPTâs name end with âGPTâ is discouraged, but not prohibited.If the GPT is part of an existing service and provides all or a subset of the same functionality, itâs recommended the GPT be named the same. For example if the service is called âMeowlyticsâ then the GPT should also be called âMeowlyticsâ. If instead the GPT is providing support for the service, then consider appending to the name, e.g., âMeowlytics API Helperâ.A GPT may not use another organizationâs trademark in its name or logo unless they are authorized to do so. Builders must verify their domain in order to use many common trademarks and OpenAI may reactively enforce this for others if reported. Additionally names referencing public figures, profanity, and harmful topics are prohibited. If a GPT makes use of third-party services, for example as part of its actions, these may be mentioned in the description.PluginsWhen referring to plugins for ChatGPT, please use the term âpluginâ rather than other names. Your company or product name should appear first, followed by OpenAI or ChatGPT. Please do not lead with the OpenAI name. (Please note that plugins are evolving into custom actions for GPTs.)Do:BarkBytes plugin for ChatGPTBarkBytes ChatGPT pluginDonât:BarkBytes plugin for OpenAIBarkBytes plugin compatible with ChatGPTBarkBytes plugin works with ChatGPTBarkBytes plugin integrated with ChatGPTNon-partnershipsOpenAI has official partnerships and specific language about these partnerships, as well as non-partnership language guidance. If you are not an official partner, please donât use âcollaborated with,â âworked with,â or âpartnered with,â in any form. Instead, we recommend you use the âPowered by OpenAIâ badge provided above.Do:Pawtopia is building on OpenAIThe Pawtopia product was developed on GPT-4Pawtopia is powered by OpenAIDonât:Pawtopia collaborated with OpenAIPawtopia worked with OpenAIPawtopia partnered with OpenAIPawtopia is building with OpenAIContent attributionIf publishing text or images generated by an OpenAI model, you are not required to attribute.

By using OpenAIâs Marks, you agree that we own them and that any goodwill generated by your use benefits us. Your permission to use our Marks is limited in the following ways:You can only use our Marks as allowed by these brand guidelines.The permission we grant is non-exclusive (we can give it to others) and non-transferrable (you cannot give it to others).You should not feature our Marks more prominently than your own companyâs name or marks.We may update the guide, and you must follow changes within a reasonable time.We can review your use of our Marks and require changes if needed.We may terminate your permission to use our Marks at any time, and you must stop using them promptly.Please ensure your app follows all OpenAI usage policies. If your project leverages our APIs or models (e.g. GPT-4 or DALLÂ·E 3), we prefer you use the âPowered by OpenAIâ badge provided above. You may choose to reference a specific model in your text description, though we typically prefer that you use the general âPowered by OpenAIâ wording instead.We do not permit model names in app titles because there is concern that it confuses end users and it also triggers our enforcement mechanisms. GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT, so itâs important that you do not reference just GPT in your app descriptions (we do not permit our GPT brand to be used in product names).LogosBy using our logos, you agree to our Marks usage terms.Download logosLogo spacing & sizing Use enough spacing around the logo.
