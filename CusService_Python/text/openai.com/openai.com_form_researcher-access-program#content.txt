If you are interested in an opportunity for subsidized access, please apply for API credits.Note that this will take you to a third-party provider, SurveyMonkey Apply, where youâll need to create an account to apply.We encourage applications from early stage researchers in countries supported by our API, and are especially interested in subsidizing work from researchers with limited financial and institutional resources. Please note that the expected turnaround time for accepted applicants would be around 4â6 weeks.Before applying, please take a moment to review our Research Policy.Areas of interest includeAlignmentHow can we understand what objective, if any, a model is best understood as pursuing? How do we increase the extent to which that objective is aligned with human preferences, such as via prompt design or fine-tuning?Fairness & representationHow should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation in language models? How can language models be improved in order to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed contexts?Societal ImpactHow do we create measurements for AIâs impact on society? What impact does AI have on different domains and groups of people?Â Interdisciplinary researchHow can AI development draw on insights from other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, and sociolinguistics?Interpretability/transparencyHow do these models work, mechanistically? Can we identify what concepts theyâre using, extract latent knowledge from the model, make inferences about the training procedure, or predict surprising future behavior?Misuse potentialHow can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of âred teamingâ approaches can we develop to help AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies like this?RobustnessHow robust are large generative models to ânaturalâ perturbations in the prompt, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large generative models are more likely to be robust or not, and how does this relate to the training data? Are there techniques we can use to predict and mitigate worst-case behavior? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g., across variations in prompts)? Can we train models so that they satisfy safety properties with a very high level of reliability, even under adversarial inputs?OtherWeâre initially scoping to these areas, but welcome suggestions for future focus areas. The questions under each area are illustrative and weâd be delighted for research proposals that address different questions.Apply for API creditsResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewTeamEnterprisePricingTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2024Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
