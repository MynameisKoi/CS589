Co-founder David Okuniev has always believed forms should be as engaging and natural as possible. The company is known for pioneering the approach of asking one question at a time, the way humans do.When it comes to making forms more like human conversations, Typeform has taken a dramatic leap forward with Formless, its AI-powered platform thatâs currently in beta.Formless represents an entirely new way of gathering dataâas the name implies, it doesnât require a traditional form structure at all. Instead, the business user simply provides basic instructions, including what information to collect. The platform, built with OpenAIâs GPT-3.5 Turbo model as well as GPT-4, handles the rest.On the respondentâs side, the experience mimics a real conversation, where the next question is a reaction to the previous answer. And itâs a two-way conversation: respondents can ask their own follow-up questions, just like they would when talking to a person.Â The magic of Formless is that we make it ten times easier to make delightful and extremely powerful form experiences that donât look like a form your customers have ever seenâyet can do complicated computation, conditionals, and routing.David Okuniev, Co-founder of TypeformIntroducing Formless01:21Formless offers additional features that take advantage of OpenAIâs technology, from creating and managing forms all the way to analyzing the results.Â When setting up the form, the creator can âtrain the AI,â educating it on any subject so that it can respond to questions about the topic. The AI can also be personalized to use the brandâs tone of voice. Crucially, conversations work in any languageâthe platform automatically translates text based on the respondentâs browser language settings.Â  Finally, Formless makes it easier than ever to learn valuable insights from customers at scale. Businesses can use the platformâs AI-driven natural language analysis to transform conversational responses into data that matches any structure the business requires. Then, with the platformâs DataPilot feature, they can talk to the AI about their data, ask questions, and integrate information from various sources. This suite of capabilities lets brands quickly and effortlessly take action on their Formless results.Â Formless was built from the ground up on OpenAIâs newest models, and most likely wouldnât be possible without GPT-4. Itâs a significant achievement for the Typeform team, whose investment in OpenAIâs technology isnât new. âWe've been working with GPT since 2.0, when the team was working on VideoAsk.com,â said Oji Udezue, Chief Product Officer. âAnd now: Formless.ai. Formless is our revolutionary new product that makes forms basically disappear entirely. It's the culmination of our obsession with making the web itself more conversationalâand weâve only just scratched the surface.âResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewTeamEnterprisePricingTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2024Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
