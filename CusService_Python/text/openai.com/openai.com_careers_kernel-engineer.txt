To do this, we believe that many technical breakthroughs are needed in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, large scale optimization, active learning, among other topics.The Research Platform team builds robust and scalable software to support our research efforts. It also offers core development services for mission critical goals and applications. In the Kernel team, we write Kernels for GPUs, we build a compiler to support important AI accelerators and we help with HW/SW co-design of future AI accelerators.Â About the Role:Â As a Research Engineer for GPU Kernels, you will write hi-performance kernels for the training and inference workloads. You will work with our internal and external customers to understand their needs and develop kernels that maximize performance. You will also work backwards from the capabilities of the GPUs to make model architectures amenable for efficient training and inference. If you are excited about maximizing HBM bandwidth, optimizing for instruction issue rate, shuffling within a warp, managing the precious register space and keeping the tensor cores at high utilization, this is the perfect opportunity!This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.In this role, you will:Develop high performance GPU kernels while paying close attention to utilization and application performanceMake aggressive optimizations that overcome hardware limitationsDevelop low precision algorithms that deliver high performance with little loss of ML accuracyWork with ML engineers to develop model architectures that are amenable for efficient training and inferenceWork with our scaling team to deploy your kernels and manage our training uptimeWork with hardware vendors and advise on HW/SW co-designÂ Â Â You might thrive in this role if you:Are a strong coder with excellent skills in C/C++ and PythonHave a deep understanding of GPU and/or other AI acceleratorsHave good experience with CUDA or a related accelerator programming languageYou have experience driving ML accuracy with low precision formatsYou are able to actively collaborate with infrastructure and ML engineersHave 3+ years of relevant industry experienceGet a great deal of satisfaction with every percentage point in performance improvementThese attributes are nice to havePhD in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing.
