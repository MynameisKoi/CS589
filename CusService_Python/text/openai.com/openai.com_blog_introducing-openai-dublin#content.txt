To support that, weâre growing our presence in Europe with our newest office in Dublin, Ireland. We plan to grow a team through this year in Ireland that will propel our operations, trust and safety, go-to-market, security engineering, and legal work as part of our ongoing commitment to better serve the European market.Ireland blends a talented workforce with support for innovation and responsible business growth. Weâre excited for this partnership as we expand in Europe.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAIThe strength of Irelandâs tech and startup ecosystem across Dublin and cities like Cork, Galway, and Limerick has shown impressive growth and advancement. Weâre ready to collaborate with the government to support their National AI Strategy, as well as work with industry, startups and researchers to understand priorities and ideas for advancing AI development and deployment. Weâve taken our first steps to provide access to our technology and offer mentorship to Irish youth accelerator Patch, a non-profit that supports exceptional 16-21 year olds by having them build and learn through their own entrepreneurial projects.âIDA Ireland welcomes the decision by OpenAI to establish a European presence in Dublin. Ireland is a recognized hub for administrative, regulatory, and innovation activities for the worldâs leading digital companies. OpenAIâs investment confirms this and endorses Irelandâs focus on building a flourishing AI ecosystem,â said Michael Lohan, CEO of IDA Ireland.In addition to Irelandâs vision for AI, weâve seen how Irelandâs community works closely across the private sector, academia, government, and startups, and we sought their feedback to ensure we enter as a good partner to the region. This marks a significant milestone in our journey, enabling us to better understand, serve, and collaborate with our European partners, users, and customers.âIn order for Ireland to benefit from AI, it is essential to ensure that we have a strong, supportive ecosystem in place and we believe that companies such as OpenAI operating in Ireland can help build on our foundation to support emerging AI research and innovation, and ensure our workforce is well prepared,â said Simon Coveney, Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Employment.If you are interested in joining us, please check out the open positions in Ireland and the UK on our careers page.For media, please reach out to us with any questions atÂ press@openai.com.AuthorsOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3APIOverviewPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewTeamEnterprisePricingTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2024Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
