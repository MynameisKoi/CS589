Heâs been giving us advice since before OpenAI was born, and now heâs taking a leave from Berkeley to work with us full-time. Pieter and his lab members have been responsible for some of the most striking advances inÂ robot learningÂ andÂ deep reinforcement learning (RL)Â in recent years. Together, we will explore ways to combine unsupervised learning with RL, which we believe could address fundamental limitations in todayâs RLÂ algorithms.Shivon Zilis.Â ShivonÂ is a partner atÂ Bloomberg BetaÂ focusing on machine intelligence. She has an extremely broad view of how the space is evolving (andÂ hasÂ writtenÂ extensivelyÂ on the landscape). Weâve been going to her for advice for the past few months, and now sheâs becoming an official advisor toÂ OpenAI.We could not be more excited to work with both.
