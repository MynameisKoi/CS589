DALLÂ·E 3 represents a leap forward in our ability to generate images that exactly adhere to the text you provide.Even with the same prompt, DALLÂ·E 3 delivers significant improvements over DALLÂ·E 2.DALLÂ·E 2âAn expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula.âDALLÂ·E 3DALLÂ·E 3 is built natively on ChatGPT, which lets you use ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner and refiner of your prompts.

If you like a particular image, but itâs not quite right, you can ask ChatGPT to make tweaks with just a few words.DALLÂ·E 3 will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in early October. As with DALLÂ·E 2, the images you create with DALLÂ·E 3 are yours to use and you don't need our permission to reprint, sell or merchandise them.DALLÂ·E 3 in ChatGPT1:00A focus on safetyLike previous versions, weâve taken steps to limit DALLÂ·EÂ 3âs ability to generate violent, adult, or hateful content.Preventing harmful generationsDALLÂ·E 3 has mitigations to decline requests that ask for a public figure by name. We improved safety performance in risk areas like generation of public figures and harmful biases related to visual over/under-representation, in partnership with red teamersâdomain experts who stress-test the modelâto help inform our risk assessment and mitigation efforts in areas like propaganda and misinformation.Internal testingWeâre also researching the best ways to help people identify when an image was created with AI. Weâre experimenting with a provenance classifierâa new internal tool that can help us identify whether or not an image was generated by DALLÂ·E 3âand hope to use this tool to better understand the ways generated images might be used. Weâll share more soon.Creative controlDALLÂ·E 3 is designed to decline requests that ask for an image in the style of a living artist. Creators can now also opt their images out from training of our future image generation models.
