Wix has been helping make web development accessible to everyone since 2006. AI has long been a focus at Wixâfor example, Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence) launched in 2016 to intelligently generate a siteâs UI.In Wixâs user research, one challenge has stood out time after time: users struggle to write content for their site. Most people lack the expertise to find the right words to describe their brand. Stuck in drafting mode, theyâre unable to launch their sites quickly.When OpenAI released GPT, Wix knew theyâd found the right solution to their problem.Â  Moving quickly to integrate, Wix built the AI Text Creator, which generates a website full of engaging text from just a few user inputs. Users can further customize each text box with the AI Text Creator, where they answer prompts engineered to generate the best titles, taglines, and paragraphs for their site.Â Wixâs AI Text Creator: Generate High-Quality and Tailored Content for Websites0:25âCombining our website building expertise with OpenAIâs GPT models, Wix now provides users with unmatched text quality, which is key to a professional website,â said Hila Gat, Head of Data Science at Wix.Since the rollout of Wixâs AI Text Creator, tasks that in the past, may haveÂ taken users 10 hours are now, may now only take 10 minutes.
